# Cinema-Cameras-and-Festival-Performance
Conducted a longitudinal statistical analysis of cinema cameras used in feature films over the past 40 years to evaluate their relationship with film festival performance. Built a structured dataset linking camera models, production metadata, and festival outcomes, then applied exploratory analysis and regression techniques to identify trends, correlations, and potential biases in selection and award recognition. The project focused on separating technological adoption effects from creative and industry factors, translating findings into clear insights on how equipment choices intersect with festival success.
